  |   The year is 2132 and the earth's remaining resources have been        |
  |   mined to create Space Ribbon, a reality TV racing platform set in     |
  |   the far reaches of the galaxy. Giant pandas and tigers spew           |
  |   illuminated ribbons of solid space junk from their mouths (space      |
  |   ribbons.) Humans compete by racing on these platforms, using the      |
  |   beaten up cars left strewn across the dystopian earth of 2132. This   |
  |   hedonistic pastime has become the fastest growing sport in the        |
  |   galaxy. The aim of game is to chase down a giant space beast and      |
  |   race to enter the creature's mouth as it spews out a series of        |
  |   different psychedelic racetracks. Modify your junked up classic car   |
  |   and compete to become the intergalactic winner. The world is          |
  |   watching you...                                                       |
